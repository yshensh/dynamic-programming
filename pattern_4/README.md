# Palindromic Subsequence

## Longest Palindromic Subsequence
example.py 

Given a sequence, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS). In a palindromic subsequence, elements read the same backward and forward.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 5
Explanation: LPS is "abdba".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 3
Explanation: LPS is "ddd".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 1
Explanation: LPS could be "p", "q" or "r".
```


## Longest Palindromic Substring
example.py 

Given a string, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Substring (LPS). In a palindromic string, elements read the same backward and forward.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 3
Explanation: LPS is "bdb".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 3
Explanation: LPS is "dpd".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 1
Explanation: LPS could be "p", "q" or "r".
```


## Count of Palindromic Substrings
example.py 

Given a string, find the total number of palindromic substrings in it. Please note we need to find the total number of substrings and not subsequences.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 7
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings, "a", "b", "d", "b", "c", "a", "bdb".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 7
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings, "c", "d", "d", "p", "d", "dd", "dpd".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 3
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings,"p", "q", "r".
```


## Minimum Deletions in a String to make it a Palindrome
example.py 

Given a string, find the minimum number of characters that we can remove to make it a palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 1
Explanation: By removing "c", we get a palindrome "abdba".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 2
Explanation: Deleting "cp", we get a palindrome "ddd".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 2
Explanation: We have to remove any two characters to get a palindrome, e.g. if we 
remove "pq", we get palindrome "r".
```


## Palindromic Partitioning
example.py 

Given a string, we want to cut it into pieces such that each piece is a palindrome. Write a function to return the minimum number of cuts needed.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 3
Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "a", "bdb", "c", "a".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 2
Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "c", "d", "dpd".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 2
Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "p", "q", "r".
```

Example 4:
```
Input: = "pp"
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not need to cut, as "pp" is a palindrome.
```
