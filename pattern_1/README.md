# 0/1 Knapsack

Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.

# Equal Subset Sum Partition

Given a set of positive numbers, find if we can partition it into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both the subsets is equal.

Example 1:
```
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 4} & {2, 3}
```

Example 2:
```
Input: {1, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 3, 4} & {1, 7}
```

Example 3:
```
Input: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Output: False
Explanation: The given set cannot be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
```

# Subset Sum

Given a set of positive numbers, determine if there exists a subset whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.

Example 1:
```
Input: {1, 2, 3, 7}, S=6
Output: True
The given set has a subset whose sum is '6': {1, 2, 3}
```

Example 2:
```
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}, S=10
Output: True
The given set has a subset whose sum is '10': {1, 2, 7}
```

Example 3:
```
Input: {1, 3, 4, 8}, S=6
Output: False
The given set does not have any subset whose sum is equal to '6'.
